                        CREATE 2019-2020!As a fourth year member on CREATE, I can confidently say that the CREATE
                        environment has inspired me to step out of my comfort zone and grow year after year. So, I
                        invite you, whether you are a timid ninth-grader to a confident senior high school student, to
                        join the 2019-2020 CREATE family and make a difference in your community.</p>

                        has been one of the most incredible experiences of my life. My first year was full of so many
                        surprises! I made so many awesome friendships with so many amazing people. As soon as we got on
                        the bus to head to conference, I knew that I wanted to become a maven. And now that I'm an exec,
                        I'm so excited to make your experience as memorable as mine.</p>

                        so far. I've learned so much about the importance of taking the first step on the road to any
                        destination. The atmosphere at CREATE gradually becomes more and more surreal throughout
                        conference and it's always inspirational to see everyone's courage bloom. Besides that, I
                        absolutely loved trying to pull all-nighters with my broskis in our room. Hope to see you there!

                        there and try something new, but I promise you that all the memories, experiences, and people
                        are definitely worth it in the end. YOLO fr tho you'll never be in high school again, and so
                        yea, I really hope to see you there &lt;3</p>

                        decided to check it out! CREATE is such a special experience where I have learned so much about
                        myself and met so many lovely people. I know that stepping out of your comfort zone and trying
                        something new is always difficult, but CREATE is definitely a worthwhile experience. From
                        laughing with others during the games to late night talks, I have made so many great memories at
                        conference. If you want to try something new, meet wonderful people, and learn more about
                        yourself, I strongly encourage you to come to conference! I can't wait to meet all you beautiful
                        people there! &lt;3</p>

                        to my heart and is one of the highlights of my high school experience. I've met so many great
                        people, grown as a person and made remarkable memories. From the awesome campfires to the
                        fun-filled skits, every moment of CREATE is a lifechanging, memorable experience. To whoever's

                        incredibly inspired by the execs I saw. They seemed so happy, outgoing, and stupidly funny.
                        Their energy radiated throughout the entire room and created such a safe and positive
                        atmosphere. My goal is to give each and every delegate an opportunity to feel the way I felt.
                        CREATE is an amazing way to make new friends, and most importantly, family. Since you're here
                        reading this, and are obviously somewhat interested in attending conference, SO SIGN UP!</p>

                        for 2 years now, and it was such a great experience!! At first I had no clue what CREATE was
                        until my brother told me to sign up. I knew it was going to be fun but I didn't expect it to be
                        that much fun! This was until I went to conference and IT WAS AMAZING!!!!! The other delegates,
                        the activities, and the groups made CREATE absolutely the best. In the end you develop a whole
                        new family that you become really attached too. To summarize... CREATE was amazing. To be
                        honest...you all should come tooooo. Can't wait to see everyone at CREATE:)</p>
