                    <p class="card__text">When looking back on my high school experiences, I remember a lot of fond
                        things from CREATE. It was an opportunity to see new places, try new things, and (most
                        importantly) foster genuine human connections. I say that because going to CREATE as a delegate
                        helped me get closer to a lot of the friends I have today. I loved the experience so much and I
                        decided to become a maven, unknowing how much it was going to affect my future. Being a creative
                        worker in the industry of photography, I‚Äôve learned that the best photographers are not only
                        great at taking photos but great at interacting with people. CREATE taught me to be a lot more
                        outgoing, and is honestly a huge contributor to the interpersonal skills I have today. Whenever
                        I get comments about being such a friendly photographer, I attribute a lot of the credit to the
                        habits I picked up at CREATE.

                    <p class="card__text">To this day CREATE remains one of the most valuable life experiences I‚Äôve ever
                        had. The camp allowed me to meet dozens of people I would normally have never spoken to, but who
                        to this day remain close friends of mine. I credit much of my development as a leader to every
                        minute I spent at CREATE, from campfires to team cheers to staying up past midnight doing spicy
                        ramen challenges with my roommates (then waking up extra early as a result, yikes), the memories
                        I shared with all my fellow mavens and delegates hold a special place in my heart. CREATE offers
                        a completely safe and comfortable space for shy and outgoing people alike to develop as leaders,
                        which is why 9/10 dentists recommend CREATE for a brighter smile. üòâ</p>

                    <p class="card__text">I applied for the CREATE Conference Council in November of 2019 in hopes of
                        building my confidence in leadership as well as meeting new people with similar interests in
                        community involvement. This experience exceeded my expectations, and so much more. Not only did
                        I get to make unique memories with an amazing group of people, I learned a lot about being a
                        successful and well-rounded student, friend, and leader. At the start of the weekend, I was a
                        bit shy as it seemed like everyone else had already known each other for years. In reality, the
                        council environment was very welcoming and inclusive, and I had made good friends within the
                        first few hours. I also really enjoyed the case competition activity, as it taught me more about
                        myself, my strengths and my weaknesses, and how to collaborate with others. The ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in the
                        box‚Äù activity was a super fun way to get everyone to open up to each other. I would definitely
                        recommend CREATE, not just to Markham-located students, looking for a very enriching opportunity
                        to build character.</p>

                    <p class="card__text">CREATE remains to be one of the fondest events of my life, as I got to share
                        smiles and laughs with my friends üòÑ. If I had to choose my favourite memory about CREATE‚Äî night
                        activities. I remember my group and i running around in the dark trying to go to one from place
                        to another. Now thinking back, we were super sweaty and tired, but it was quite funny how
                        everyone looked like a swarm of minions scattered around on the field haha. CREATE taught me so
                        much about not being afraid to reach out to people because everyone is super duper friendly and
                        kind (don't worry, people are not as scary as you may think) üòÅ. In fact, I am probably still
                        that one timid and shy girl, but deep down inside my heart, I got little more courage. Connect
                        with the people around you‚Äî new and old‚Äî don't forget to share some happiness (or food) üòÜ.</p>
