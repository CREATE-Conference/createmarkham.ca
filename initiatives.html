              We are a collaborated team with teams 1 & 3! What we do is support
              physical wellness to our audience whether it is motivating people
              to become physically fit or giving workouts online for people to
              follow! We want people to be able to feel comfortable and healthy
              with their own body because taking care of yourself is really
              important! This is beneficial to our audience because we give
              motivation so that they stay productive and use their time better.
              The goal is to make everyone feel physically healthy and overall
              stay more productive with their life. Some potential upcoming
              events to watch out for from our team could be a guest speaker who
              then explains why it’s important to stay physically fit or maybe a
              live workout where everyone can workout together!

              Connect with Create aims to promote social wellness through
              meaningful connections in our community. With social media
              platforms such as Discord and Instagram, individuals can branch
              out into discovering new hobbies, building new friendships, and
              joining a welcoming environment with people similar to you! Social
              Wellness is something that we find very important in today's world
              amid current circumstances revolving around the pandemic. With
              social wellness, it is important to ensure that individuals have
              supportive connections that are significant through these tough
              times. Our first event will be a Valentine’s Day Movie Night on
              Saturday, Feb 12th and it will be hosted on our discord server! It
              provides a chance for our community that we have built, to come
              together and bond over a past time that everyone enjoys! After
              that, we hope to plan more events that will promote the overall
              well-being of social wellness!

              Studio Create aka Teams 5 and 7 have joined together to engage our
              community through creative wellness! We plan to have monthly
              prompts on our instagram @5tudio_crea7e to give students an outlet
              to display any form of art! They can submit paintings, photography
              pieces, dances, cooking, and more! In the spring, our team hopes
              to host a cultural event where students can come together and
              learn more about the different types of artwork, food, and history
              in each culture!! Stay tuned… it’s going to be exciting :)!!!

              LEAFE (Leading Environmental Actions For Everyone), is a
              student-led non-profit organization that focuses on influencing
              positive environmental action and sparking initiative amongst
              their community. Join LEAFE on their journey by listening to their
              podcast where they share their genuine conversations and
              lighthearted thoughts about having an environmentally friendly
              lifestyle. They cover a variety of different subjects, with each
              topic relating to how communities are able to make an impact on
              the world, no matter how significant. If podcasts are not your
              thing, then tune in to their Youtube channel (LEAFE), where they
              invite you to laugh and smile through their entertaining content.
              All the while, check out their Instagram @leafe.create for simple
              posts and bi-weekly reminders to be more conscious of the
              environment. Watch out for a possible garbage pick-up event later
              in the year, where individuals can earn prizes and experience the
              feeling of joy by helping the community take one step closer to
              having a cleaner future! While LEAFE makes an impact, they hope to
              promote others to do the same :)
