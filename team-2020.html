                        fourth year on create and let me tell you that joining create as a delegate in grade nine was
                        one of the best decisions i could have ever made. this council and conference has brought me so
                        many amazing memories and i know it sounds like cap everytime people say this but i mean it when
                        i say i‚Äôve met some of my best friends through this conference. i really hope you all give us a
                        chance this year despite everything going on and, although i can‚Äôt promise you that you‚Äôll have
                        an awesome time (even though it‚Äôs pretty likely :0), i CAN promise you that we will not have

                        cool people. From eating the snacks you‚Äôve packed with your roomies from dusk till dawn, or
                        singing at the top of your lungs around the campfire AND trying to wake up to the 8am wake up
                        call LOLOLO, I promise this is a special opportunity you don‚Äôt want to miss. So come apply & be
                        a part of something truly magical, our CREATE family! BRUH BRO trust me, you won‚Äôt regret any

                        filled with (pleasant) surprises, not to mention all the amazing people you meet and all the
                        cozy memories mmmmm. When I‚Äôm not at CREATE you can catch me at the studio dancing and

                        sharing a room with your homies and campfire, you can experience all that in CREATE. I know, I
                        know, going to a new place where you have to step out of your comfort zone to meet new people
                        can be hard, but hey, never try never know. I met so many interesting people during CREATE, we
                        laughed together, hanged out together and even cry together. Yeah, CREATE is an amazing event,
                        it gives you opportunities that you do not normally have in the school and you get to be your
                        true self. Anyway, after all this self promotes, I am looking forward to meeting all of you at
                        the conference, if COVID gets better‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ but believe me, IT WILL :)</p>

                        12 student at Pierre Elliott Trudeau High School, and this is my fourth and (sadly) final year
                        on CREATE. I heard a lot of good things about conference when I was in Grade 9, so I decided to
                        check it out, and I am proud to say that it's been one of my most memorable high school
                        experiences to this day. I had the opportunity to talk to people from all grades; something I
                        was always afraid of doing at the start of high school. Besides singing around a campfire,
                        roasting marshmallows and staying up all night talking (lol), CREATE has given me the chance to
                        reflect and work on myself, never failing to teach me something new every year. Although this
                        year's conference may look a little different than usual, I promise it will still be an amazing
                        opportunity to take leadership in your community while forming new friendships! I can't wait to
                        see you all there :D</p>
