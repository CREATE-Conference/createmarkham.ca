              hi there everyone! i’m christar and super thrilled to be this
              years co-president alongside the wonderful, the beautiful, ms
              summer chu!! this is my fourth and final year on CREATE & let me
              tell you, it’s been a journey (shoutout team 7 up, team 7
              deadpool, team 8 arthur & team 15 fruit ninja ily all) create
              holds such a special place in my heart, from all the cozy memories
              to the inside jokes, and even though i can’t promise you’ll have a
              good time, i can promise you’ll get longer breaks during online
              conference this year.
            </p>
            <p class="card__text">
              nonetheless in my free time you can catch me watching anime (drop
              recs pls), taking 16 hour naps (which is why i don’t respond) or
              listening to rnb music (my friends never give me the aux though).
              i can chug a bottle of water in under 10 seconds and i’m the best
              driver in my friendgroup (i’m not g2 bound yet but i will claim
              this title).
            </p>
            <p class="card__text">
              despite conference being online, we hope each and every one of you
              join our create family and hopefully get a chance to experience
              the real taste of create (in person) at retreat. anyways catch
              flights not feels 💪 test negative but stay positive 😹. my lovely
              team & i can’t wait for you to see what we have in store this
              year, so stay tuned!

              Hi everyone! I'm Andrew and I'm super thrilled to be your
              Technology Chairperson for CREATE 2020-21! Over the past couple of
              months, I've had the pleasure to work with my fellow execs and let
              me tell you, they are AMAZING people, and I'm super excited to
              show all of you what we have planned for this year's CREATE
              conference! The conference is an awesome opportunity for you to
              make new friends, discover more about yourself, and most
              importantly, have lots of FUN! Speaking of which, here are some of
              my hobbies that will hopefully help you get to know me better!
              During my free time, I enjoy coding, playing (and coaching)
              tennis, drinking bubble tea, and listening to music! That being
              said, if you ever come across me, feel free to talk to me! Whether
              it be questions about CREATE, music recommendations, or just a
              casual chat, I'd love to get to know you better! On a final note,
              CREATE is an incredible event, and I am so excited to see all your
              beautiful faces there! :)

              hi everyone!!! i’m jier and i’m delighted to be one of your
              activities chairs for this year! this is my second year on create
              and i’m looking forward to the exciting year ahead of us full of
              laughs, leadership and lovely people :) my create experience has
              been amazing so far; from playing games to meeting new people,
              it’s safe to say that i had a lot of fun at create and made a ton
              of lasting memories. outside of create you can find me drawing,
              listening to true crime podcasts, or watching kdramas (give me
              recs pls!!!) anyway, create is definitely a wonderful opportunity
              you don’t want to miss out on and i really hope to see you there
              &lt;3
